This repository contains the dummy device for simulating the Signal phone app. The code depends on the [ZXing.Net](https://github.com/micjahn/ZXing.Net) and the [libsignal-service-dotnet](https://github.com/signal-csharp/libsignal-service-dotnet) library. The latter has been slightly fixed to make the device registration work. We will contribute the patches to the upstream library at some point.
